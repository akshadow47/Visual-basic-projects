# Visual-basic-projects
this readme file is for every VBS project i post here
i have no problem in people use it just don't copy paste it and claim it as original work by you.

Little description of how to use VBS code -->

step 1 - copy the code and paste it in a application like notepad or notepad++

step 2 -( the final one) -save the file wherever you want but make sure to change it's extension from .txt to .vb or .vbs

if you want to run it just double click the file and see it work !
